#developer log
#2024/5/18 After uploading to the backend, the frontend can feed back the most basic json

#2024/5/25 Complete the homemade arduino development board and connect the LC760Z, DHT11 and soil moisture sensor to complete the serial port transmission
#2024/6/5 After a week of rest, I finally started this project again. Now it can perfectly push data to the front end and you can see its real-time data on the front-end web page, and it has improved the logic handling of data transmission errors
